# train-scheduler

## About this project

For this project, I used Google Firebase database and moment.js to build a train scheduler. When a user inputs data, that data is stored to Firebase. I use jQuery to append that data.  With moment.js, I was able to calculate Date objects and present information on when a train was arriving and how many minutes until it arrived. 

## How it works

The train scheduler app has 3 main functions: 
1. A function that reads and stores user input.
1. A function that displays that user input data.
1. A function that calculates a train's frequency based on the user input.


Because the data is stored in Firebase, the data is persistent. This means that multiple users will be able to see the same informatino on the train data. 

## Known Issues

Currently, there are no known issues.
